You are a very experienced game designer, programmer, and artist. Let's create based on Godot a very epic metroidvania that takes the naive style of Hollow Knight and the setup of Blasphemous. The game will be called Xistra.
The game setup is in the galician folklore.
The player is a woman named Xacinta in her fifties with a farmer flavour that roams the world discovering it, making friends, vanquishing enemies and improving her abilities. Along the game setup she will be encountering artifacts and creatures of the galician folklore. These will have flavour texts explaining the history and origins in an educative manner.

Along the game Xacinta will find weapons that will have a nice variety of combos and stones / figures with galician symbols like "figa" that will give extra abilities to he weapons.
At some point of the game Xacinta will find out that she is far family from men-wolf.
Weapons and artifacts:
- The starting base weapon will be a hoe called "Sacho". This will be the balanced and main weapon.
    - Getting further stones/figurines Sacho will get more powerful and the ability to trow giant worms that smash the enemies. 
- A secondary weapon will be found along the way will be a sickle called "Fouce". This will be the quick and low damage weapon option.
    - Getting further stones/figurines Fouce will get more powerful and the ability to imprison enemies in briars "toxos"
- Another secondary weapon will be a galleon anchor called "Áncora". This will be the slow and powerful weapon. 
    - Getting further stones/figurines Áncora will get more powerful and the ability to unleash a sean wave engulfing the enemies.

She would be besting enemies and getting further abilities from them and befriending some. Some of the enemies might be:
- "O veciño" the neighbor. Trying to pass trough a blocked path Xacinta will move one of the stones that mark his land "marco". From him Xacinta will get "Fouce". 
- "O morto da costa" the dead of the coast is a pirate the perished in "A costa da morte" and haunts the place. From him Xacinta will get "Áncora".
- "Sereas" along the coast hunting sailors.
- "O lobisome" will encounter the man-wolf in o Courel. From him she will get the wolf transformation.
- "A moura" under a dolmen she will encounter a "Moura" hoarding all the riches of the area in her cave.
- The kraken on Vigo's Range bridge.
- "Gerion's" comes from under Hercules tower due to a head-ache. Something related to Breogan here maybe as ally. 
- The romans re-taking Lugo's walled city.
- The "Celtas" re-taking A Guarda's castro.
- The "Trasnos" taking Tui's cathedral. But the read bad one was the "Obispo" of Tui.
- "Santiago Apostol" in Santiago cathedral.
- "Maruxaina" lost in Ourenses' thermal waters.
- "Meigas" called in along the fires of "San Xoan". A general easter egg of the game could be finding hidden "Meigas" along the game for 100% completion "Habelas hailas"
- "Serpe alada" guarding a treasure in tha intersection of Miño and Sil rivers.  
- "Santa Compaña" aas final boss of the game.

Technical generalities.
- The game should be multi-languaje. Galician, Spanish and English.
- The saving points should be the typical galician "Horreos" maybe as well used as common stash?
- At some point of the game the typical galician "Cruceiros" could be activated as way portals for quick travel.
- Create a start screen to load the game, start it, see cinematic and credits. 

Development:
- Create unit tests, scene tests and smoke test for the game.
