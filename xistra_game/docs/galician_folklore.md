# Galician Folklore in Xistra

This document explains the real Galician folklore elements that inspired the characters, items, and concepts in Xistra.

## Characters

### O veci単o (The Neighbor)
In Galician folklore, neighbors (veci単os) are often portrayed with a mix of helpfulness and territorial protectiveness. The concept in Xistra reflects this territorial aspect, where the neighbor zealously guards his land.

### O morto da costa (The Dead of the Coast)
The coast of Galicia, particularly "A costa da morte" (The Coast of Death), is known for its shipwrecks. The dead who perished in these wrecks are said to haunt the shores, sometimes appearing as ghostly pirates or sailors.

### Sereas (Sea Sirens)
Similar to mermaids, sereas are aquatic beings who lure sailors to their doom with beautiful songs. They are a common element in Galician maritime folklore.

### O lobisome (Werewolf)
The Galician werewolf legend is tied to the region of O Courel. Unlike other werewolf myths, the Galician lobisome is often seen as a protector of livestock rather than a threat.

### A moura (The Moorish Woman)
Mouras are mystical female beings in Galician folklore, often associated with ancient Roman ruins (called "castros moros" or Moorish castros). They are guardians of hidden treasures.

### Santa Compa単a (The Holy Company)
A ghostly procession of spirits, often seen as an omen of death. The Santa Compa単a appears as a group of clergy and penitents moving in a funeral procession.
